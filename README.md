# SMHI Weather Forecast, Warnings, Fire Risk & Ocean Observations for Homey

Weather forecasts, official weather warnings, fire-risk forecasts and ocean observations from SMHI for Homey. Weather forecasts use **SNOW1gv1**, warnings use SMHI's official impact-based warning feed, fire risk uses the daily **FWIF1G** point forecast, and sea-level/wave devices use SMHI Oceanographic Observations.

## Features

- Create multiple weather devices with independent settings.
- Use Homey's geolocation or a custom latitude/longitude.
- Select forecast offsets from **now up to 36 hours**.
- Weather, temperature and feels-like temperature.
- Wind direction, wind speed and gust speed.
- Relative humidity, air pressure and visibility.
- Thunderstorm probability.
- Total, low, medium and high cloud cover.
- Precipitation type and precipitation statistics.
- Flow triggers for weather changes and selected sensor changes.
- Flow conditions for weather, temperature, wind, cloud cover and precipitation.
- Forecast-oriented conditions such as rain, maximum wind speed and minimum temperature within the next hours.
- A separate **SMHI Weather Warnings** device for official Yellow, Orange and Red warnings at the configured location.
- Warning Flow triggers for issued, updated and ended warnings, plus conditions for current warning state and severity.
- A separate **SMHI Fire Risk** device with daily forest fire risk, grass fire risk and forest fuel dryness forecasts from today through five days ahead.
- Fire-risk Flow triggers for class changes and conditions for minimum risk/dryness levels.
- Separate **SMHI Sea Level** and **SMHI Waves** devices bound to named SMHI ocean observation stations.
- Sea-level RH2000, observation age/quality, significant and maximum wave height, wave period and wave direction where available.
- Ocean Flow cards for sea-level threshold crossings and wave-height thresholds.

The app is intended for locations within SMHI's SNOW forecast area and is primarily presented for Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland.

## Weather warnings

v0.9.0 adds a separate **SMHI Weather Warnings** device. It matches the configured/Homey coordinates against SMHI's actual GeoJSON warning areas and exposes the highest-priority matching warning, validity period, warning area, warning count and SMHI as the source.

The driver intentionally handles official **Yellow, Orange and Red** weather warnings. SMHI `MESSAGE` entries are excluded from this device. Official warning text is shown from SMHI without machine translation or rewriting.

## Fire risk

v0.10.0 adds a separate **SMHI Fire Risk** device using SMHI's daily FWIF1G point forecast. It keeps three SMHI concepts separate: **forest fire risk**, **grass fire risk** and **forest fuel dryness**.

The device supports today through five days ahead, Homey's geolocation or custom coordinates, and displays the source approval time. Forest fire risk and forest fuel dryness preserve SMHI's **1–5E** presentation; API class `6` is displayed as `5E`. Missing/off-season model values are not treated as low risk.

If a reliable forecast cannot be obtained for the selected location/day, the device becomes unavailable rather than presenting stale data as current.

**Fire risk is a forecast, not an official fire ban.** Users must follow fire bans and restrictions issued by the responsible authorities.

## Sea level and waves

v0.11.0 adds two station-based ocean observation devices:

- **SMHI Sea Level** — measured sea level in RH2000 from a selected SMHI/Sjöfartsverket station, including observation time, age, quality and source.
- **SMHI Waves** — measured significant wave height from a selected wave buoy/station, with maximum wave height, mean period and wave direction when those measurements are available at the same station.

Pairing lists actual stations rather than silently choosing a nearby station. The station ID is the Homey device identity, and the station name/owner are shown on the device.

Sea Level reads the latest RH2000 minute observations and allows normal publication latency before declaring data stale. Waves requires a recent significant-wave-height measurement; optional wave fields may be absent without making the device unavailable.

Wave direction prefers SMHI's mean direction when fresh and falls back to direction at Tp/peak wave energy when that is the current direction series for the buoy. The displayed compass direction follows SMHI's convention: the direction **from which** the waves come.

## Flow cards

Existing Flow card IDs and capability IDs are preserved for backwards compatibility. v0.8.0 also adds:

- **Weather changes to ...**
- **Weather changes from ... to ...**
- Forecast conditions for rain, maximum wind speed and minimum temperature in the coming hours.
- A **Severe weather condition** trigger based on forecast symbols. This is an app-level condition and **not an official SMHI weather warning**.

## Important upgrade note for v0.8.0

v0.8.0 corrects several interpretation problems introduced during the v0.7.0 migration to SNOW1gv1, including wind heading and precipitation classification.

If you changed a Flow to compensate for incorrect values in v0.7.0, review that Flow after upgrading. For example, a wind direction that was previously shown with the wrong compass heading is now mapped correctly.

## Data source and update behavior

Weather data is fetched from SMHI's SNOW1gv1 point forecast API. Each device refreshes automatically and also refreshes immediately when its forecast time or location settings change.

Transient API/network failures are retried. If a fetch fails completely, the app keeps the last successfully received capability values and logs the error.

## Dependency policy

The app has **zero third-party runtime dependencies**. Network access uses Node's built-in HTTPS module and the feels-like calculation is implemented locally with regression tests.

`package-lock.json` is intentionally kept even with zero dependencies so CI can verify the dependency graph deterministically. `.npmrc` uses `save-exact=true` so any future dependency must be added explicitly and pinned.

## Development

Before switching branches or starting a new test cycle, verify that the local working tree is clean:

```bash
npm run clean-check
```

Then prepare npm metadata and run the regression tests:

```bash
npm ci
npm test
```

Run the app on a connected Homey:

```bash
homey app run
```

## Change log

### v0.11.0

- Added separate **SMHI Sea Level** and **SMHI Waves** devices.
- Pairing uses named active ocean observation stations and wave buoys.
- Sea Level exposes measured RH2000 level, station, observation time/age, quality and source.
- Waves exposes significant and maximum wave height, mean wave period and wave direction where supported.
- Wave direction falls back from mean direction to direction at Tp/peak energy when needed.
- Added Flow triggers for sea-level threshold crossings and wave-height threshold crossings.
- Added corresponding conditions for current sea level and wave height.
- Added freshness handling so stale primary measurements make the relevant device unavailable.
- Added dedicated ocean, sea-level and wave icons plus regression coverage for station selection, observation age and direction fallback.

### v0.10.0

- Added a separate **SMHI Fire Risk** device.
- Daily forecasts for today through five days ahead.
