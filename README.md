This app adds support for Swedish Weather Data.

The app currently includes 0-8 days Weather forecast and 0-3 days Pollen level forecast.

What's new

v.0.2.0
First public Beta.
- Weather forecast data from SMHI
- Pollen level forecast
- Trigger cards
- Condition cards
- All data available as tokens

Known issues:
- if you add more than one of each device it will look great and enable to have several devices with separate data/hours/cities... problem is that once you restart the app they all fall back to one and source of data. (so don't.. or uppdate settings on them manually after reboot/restart of app).
